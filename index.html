                <p>
                    Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (c. 780 – c. 850) was a Persian polymath who made significant
                    contributions
                    to mathematics, astronomy, and geography. Known as the father of algebra, his works introduced
                    systematic solutions to linear and quadratic equations. His Latinized name, Algoritmi, is the origin
                    of
                    the term
                    "algorithm."
